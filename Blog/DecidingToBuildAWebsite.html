            <h1 style = "color: darkred;">Deciding to Build a Website</h1>
            <h5>Web development, June 9th 2020</h5>
            <div class="blogimg" style = "background-image: url('BlogImages/June9BlogImage.svg');"></div>
            <h4 style = "font-style: italic;">I have never had so much fun doing something so technical and challenging. I have had to build not only this website but my entire knowledge of web development from the ground up, and I’ve loved it.</h4>
            <p>I stress, before embarking on this project I knew nothing of web development. I could probably have told you that websites were written in html, but beyond that I was truly clueless to the field. I’d heard my Mum, who herself was a software developer, mention CSS and PHP, but I had no idea what these languages were used for. I really did begin from an empty knowledge base.</p>
            <p>As I mentioned in my last blog, however, I have experience in data science and statistical programming. I understood the logic and the syntax of R and Python and as a result I was aware of coding principles that might not be immediately apparent to a true novice.</p>
            <p>This prior exposure benefitted me to a huge extent.</p>
            <p>I felt like a competent Spanish speaker dabbling in Italian for the first time. Everything felt familiar yet foreign. Continuing the metaphor, whilst I could not immediately speak Italian, I felt able to quickly understand the syntax and rules of these new languages.</p>
            <p>Again, I had no gauge of what to expect. As I had been instructed by the CTO of my last company, I began learning JavaScript and completed an introductory course. I have to say, I enjoyed that course on Udacity. It was structured well and allowed plenty of opportunity for consolidation. However, I came out with no concept of what to do with what I’d learned. I quickly, realised that without knowledge of html and CSS, my new knowledge was near useless in practice.</p>
            <p>I was back to square one, taking an introductory course in html. This was when I realised how I learn best – I learn by play. I found that videos and tutorials and websites such as w3schools were helpful, but I couldn’t commit anything to memory. How I truly learned was by taking what I was reading and applying it in practice, messing around and seeing what I could produce. This must be why I enjoy those courses that take the time for consolidation and provide quizzes.</p>
            <p>I quickly took a liking to CSS. I have a strong appreciation for design, especially digital design and in technology, and finding how CSS so simplistically and logically allowed me to completely customise the output of my code was game-changing.</p>
            <p>I began by first designing interfaces for little tools. I began by creating an ‘app’ that could control the background colour (simple I know). I then moved onto designing a working counter, and then an interface for an online calculator. I found that making the calculator actually work was above my level, but that was okay. Rather than getting stuck with a task obviously above my skill level, I moved to consolidate what I did know and increase my knowledge base gradually.</p>
            <p>Creating custom buttons became my interest for a day, and by doing so I learned how to import icons and animate using CSS. I then investigated designing website templates and realised that producing a functioning webpage was fully within my capabilities. I didn’t have the skills at the time, but I knew I had the ability and the drive to learn how to.</p>
            <p>Creating templates for a webpage came surprisingly quickly, and I knew I needed to turn this into a project with an outcome. I knew I could do it. <span style = "font-style: italic;">I just needed an idea for what to create</span>.</p>
