            <h1 style = "color: darkred;">Why I Started to Learn Web Development</h1>
            <h5>Web development, August 6th 2020</h5>
            <div class="blogimg" style = "background-image: url('BlogImages/August6BlogImage.svg');"></div>
            <h4 style = "font-style: italic;">I am not a web developer. Not by trade and definitely not by education. I am a student of the life sciences, yet through a curious mind and a few significant nudges, you are able to sit here and read this on a site developed purely from scratch.</h4>
            <p>The passion I now have for coding and programming cannot be traced far back in my life. I left school at 18 as a budding scientist ready to begin my time at University College London throwing myself into the biological sciences. I had an interest in genetics and genomics, but beyond a preference for human biology I cannot tell you I knew specifically where my life and career was heading.</p>
            <p>The first nudge towards where I am now was the introduction of a novel degree stream within my department. I am now able to transition to a degree stream that they call <span style = "font-style: italic;">Computational Biology</span>. Because of this, I was handed my first exposure to coding – RStudio.</p>
            <p>We used RStudio primarily as a mechanism for making statistical inferences and conclusions on our data. This makes sense. RStudio is the preferred platform for many life scientists and I’m grateful that my university provide us with such early exposure to the platform. I enjoyed the tool a lot, and it became my go-to software for all data crunching, replacing Excel spreadsheets in my studies.</p>
            <p>As I dove deeper into this world during my second year, I was exposed to the notion that knowing RStudio simply will not be enough. I didn’t and still don’t have a burning desire to enter a scientific research career, and within industry there is a desire for a wider toolkit: Python, SQL, JavaScript. I couldn’t rest on my laurels with just this surface level knowledge.</p>
            <p>I began and made significant progress with a Machine Learning for Python course on SkillShare. I must be honest, whilst it was brilliant in exposing me to the language, the processes and the techniques, the course was inadequate. There was no consolidation, the teacher rushed to pack in content and it felt devoid of an end goal. I just wasn’t <span style = "font-style: italic;">learning</span>. I felt lost in a sea of information that I wasn’t taking in.</p>
            <p>However, at the same time I was undergoing an internship with a London-based SaaS startup specialising in bringing data science to the masses. My knowledge of data science as an enterprise skyrocketed. Whilst my role was in data science, I felt great intrigue in how they created the software itself. I realised that while data science feels more and more like the future, it is the programming behind this that is really pulling the strings.</p>
            <p>In my last conversation with the CTO of the company, his best advice for me was to begin learning JavaScript as soon as possible, and to push myself towards being a full-stack developer. It felt ridiculous at the time, as I could not say I knew a single language involved, but the message sat with me, nonetheless.</p>
            <p>I knew it would be tough to juggle beginning this learning odyssey alongside a university degree and leading my university lacrosse club, but I had an intrigue itch that needed to be scratched. <span style = "font-style:italic;">Perhaps I could be a developer</span>.</p>
            <p>The learning curve is steep, yet with only 10 days of learning under my belt and the first beta version of my site hosted on GitHub Pages, I feel a drive to continue. The only way for me, is up.</p>
