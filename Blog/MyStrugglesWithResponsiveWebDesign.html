            <h1 style = "color: darkred;">My Struggles with Responsive Web Design</h1>
            <h5>Web development, August 18th 2020</h5>
            <div class="blogimg" style = "background-image: url('BlogImages/June18BlogImage.svg');"></div>
            <h4 style = "font-style: italic;">Taking this next step with my website really has been challenging. I have at least been forced to learn a lot about flexibility and the importance of keeping an open mind to web design though.</h4>
            <p>At the end of my last blog, I mentioned that my next task was to transform my webpage so that it could be viewed on mobile as well as it can on desktop. I thought I knew how this would be achieved.</p>
            <p>I had set my sights on learning Bootstrap 4, a CSS framework favoured for being robust across different screen sizes. I sunk a sizeable chunk of time down this rabbit hole, and progressed very little.</p>
            <p>I enjoy the immense flexibility at your fingertips in designing through pure html and CSS, and I felt like Bootstrap took away that magic. The framework provides the user with pre-designed elements, corralling you into a well-designed theme consistent across all tags. This means that without any additional effort, your buttons match the design of your inputs, headings and more. This is great when your end goal is simply a working page, but it takes away the freedom, <span style = "font-style: italic;">and it takes away the fun</span>.</p>
            <p>So, I moved on. I didn’t feel like this tool was for me. Just like the best of chefs need knives that feel comfortable in their grasp, I needed a toolkit that felt right <span style = "font-style: italic;">for me</span>.</p>
            <p>In the first version of my site, I had employed CSS Grid to manage my layout and perfect the aesthetic I had envisioned. There were problems though. I had used way too many fixed element sizes, a problem even a responsive layout couldn’t fix. Furthermore, the CSS Grid container method is not very well suited to media queries that stack columns on small screens. This was a deal-breaker for me.</p>
            <p>I instead made the switch to the grid-view method under the Responsive Web Design section of W3Schools. By having floating columns, my pages became much more malleable with elements resizing efficiently. As it turns out, I had to integrate this new layout system throughout every section of my website, which was time-consuming at best and exhausting at worst.</p>
            <p>The entire website had to be rebuilt from scratch. On the bright side, this odyssey forced me to better organise my repository and move all unique stylisations of blog entries into the html, allowing one consistent stylesheet for all blog entries.</p>
            <p>I’m not quite sure what lies next for me. I’d like to start incorporating more sophisticated, most likely JavaScript-oriented methods, so it will be worth researching where these queries might be best utilized. I may also begin another project, this time aimed more at solving a problem, and I will begin listing ideas for what I can attempt.</p>
