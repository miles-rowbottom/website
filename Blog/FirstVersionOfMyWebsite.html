            <h5>Web development, August 13th 2020</h5>
            <div class="blogimg" style = "background-image: url('BlogImages/August13BlogImage.svg');"></div>
            <h4 style = "font-style: italic;">Here I am. A fully functioning, well-designed website available for the world to site. Created by me. It’s a feeling that’s hard to describe, but I’ll do my best to.</h4>
            <p>Beginning this project, I can’t say I exactly knew what my end goal was. I’d seen some examples of nicely designed personal websites online, and there were features of these that not only did I want to emulate, I also simply wanted to learn how to code.</p>
            <p>One personal website that significantly inspired my creation belongs to Gary Sheng of <a class = "garyShengLink" href = "https.www.garysheng.com">www.garysheng.com<a/>. It was a chic, modern-looking site that he’d programmed himself. The fact that he was also a software developer is perhaps something that drew me to it. His website isn’t the most complex or sprawling; <span style = "font-style: italic;">it’s simple</span>. It felt attainable whilst being of a level that I’d be proud to have created.</p>
            <p>Right at the beginning of this project I had discovered and practiced using CSS Grid. This style gave me to flexibility I needed to have my website work both on my 13” laptop and my 25” monitor. I was able to create pages that were responsive on a wide range of desktop screens, if not yet usable on mobile or tablet.</p>
            <p>For me though, that’s okay. I have only been learning web development for less than 2 weeks, and it’s important for me that I don’t get hung up on my perfectionism. I am understanding that at this time I just don’t have the skills or knowledge required to create my perfect website, and I’m still happy because I can see the progress in front of my eyes.</p>
            <p>I decided that including a personal blog on the site would be beneficial for me. Not only is it an added level of complexity to aid me on my learning curve, it can also become a space for me to open up and talk. I’m not the strongest communicator, especially when discussing personal matters, and my girlfriend has long suggested that a written journal would help with that.</p>
            <p>I see myself as a strong writer, but I often rejected her idea as I saw nothing to write about. Now, I have a journey to detail and a story to share, and I can do it all in the moment. I see it as a positive feedback loop where I expand my programming skillset by designing myself a platform in which I can then improve my ability to express myself. This in turn fuels more desire to program.</p>
            <p>My journey is just beginning, as I learn new skills that help improve my website and transform it into my dream platform.</p>
            <p>My next steps? Learning responsive web design to bring this website to users on mobile as well as devices of all sizes. My early research points to Bootstrap 4 being the best system for achieving this goal, but I remain open to new ideas.</p>
